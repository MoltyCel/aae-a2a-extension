# Reported cross-runs

One JSON file per run, in the format of [TEMPLATE.json](TEMPLATE.json) and
[CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md#result-file). CI validates every file here with
`python -m aae_a2a.crossrun check`.

File name: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<participant>-<role>.json`, where role is `client`
(your client against the reference supplier), `server` (the reference buyer
against your server), `both` or `offline` (an offline receiver run,
[CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md) Section 6.1).

## Credit

Each run is credited to the participant who ran it, with the commits of both
sides as recorded in the result file. A run with failures is listed as well;
the failure is a finding about one of the two sides, not about the participant.

The column *Receiver provenance* says how the side the participant built was
written, as the participant states it ([CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md), Section 6):
`clean_room`, `reference_informed` or `unknown`. Where the participant has not
said, it is `unknown`. It is never inferred from the result: a row with every
case passed says nothing about how the receiver was written.

A run holds for the cases it ran ([CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md), Section 7.1).
The column *Cases* names the commit of this repository whose `cases.json` the
run used, its `cases_commit`; a later re-run against newer cases gets a row of
its own.

The first third-party run is Prasanna Bableshwar's, in the offline form,
against the cases at `6c857ee`. He states its provenance in
[a2aproject/A2A#2391](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/issues/2391#issuecomment-6702944083):
"The receiver was written from the profile text alone, so on the provenance
field you are adding, this run reads clean-room." Its limits, in his own words
([findings.md](https://github.com/bprasana/aae-a2a-crossrun/blob/04cc8c5966b8a1a4f63495a4e4ce6d71f8f3cdc7/findings.md)):
"The run was not blind. The expected results are published in the cases file
and in the guide, and the implementer had read them." And: "It does not
establish conformance of this receiver to the profile, because the interactive
run the guide defines was not performed. It does not establish that a second
implementation would agree on inputs neither has seen, in particular on the
nonce format and the iat window, where the text is silent." His
[run-report.md](https://github.com/bprasana/aae-a2a-crossrun/blob/04cc8c5966b8a1a4f63495a4e4ce6d71f8f3cdc7/run-report.md)
states the offline form and the artefacts it builds instead of the transport;
his six named inventions are carried in the result file.

The file above restates his run in the format of this repository. His own
result file is kept unchanged at
[sources/2026-10-30-prasanna-bableshwar-offline.source.json](sources/2026-10-30-prasanna-bableshwar-offline.source.json)
(from `bprasana/aae-a2a-crossrun` at `04cc8c5`, records in `a68bb04`,
sha256 `45474183ddc0080592f11ffa0e1a534f239e9ee253289d713a5f4a464435acf3`).

Tymofii Pidlisnyi states the provenance of his run by mail (2026-11-09):
"I read the reference build_aae during a code review before the run, which excludes clean_room under your definition. My client was written from the draft, profile and CROSSRUN.md, and shares no code with the reference."
