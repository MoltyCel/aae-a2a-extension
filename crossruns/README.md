# Reported cross-runs

One JSON file per run, in the format of [TEMPLATE.json](TEMPLATE.json) and
[CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md#result-file). CI validates every file here with
`python -m aae_a2a.crossrun check`.

File name: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<participant>-<role>.json`, where role is `client`
(your client against the reference supplier), `server` (the reference buyer
against your server), `both` or `offline` (an offline receiver run,
[CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md) Section 6.1).

## Credit

Each run is credited to the participant who ran it, with the commits of both
sides as recorded in the result file. A run with failures is listed as well;
the failure is a finding about one of the two sides, not about the participant.

A run holds for the cases it ran ([CROSSRUN.md](../CROSSRUN.md), Section 7.1).
The column *Cases* names the commit of this repository whose `cases.json` the
run used, its `cases_commit`; a later re-run against newer cases gets a row of
its own.

The limits of that run, in the participant's own words
([findings.md](https://github.com/bprasana/aae-a2a-crossrun/blob/04cc8c5966b8a1a4f63495a4e4ce6d71f8f3cdc7/findings.md)):
"The run was not blind. The expected results are published in the cases file
and in the guide, and the implementer had read them." And: "It does not
establish conformance of this receiver to the profile, because the interactive
run the guide defines was not performed. It does not establish that a second
implementation would agree on inputs neither has seen, in particular on the
nonce format and the iat window, where the text is silent." His

states the offline form and the artefacts it builds instead of the transport;
his six named inventions are carried in the result file.

The file above restates his run in the format of this repository. His own
result file is kept unchanged at
