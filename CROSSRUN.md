# Cross-Run Guide

A cross-run checks one implementation of the
[AAE extension for A2A](spec/aae-a2a-extension-v1.md) against another: your
client against the reference supplier, the reference buyer against your
server, or both. This guide lists what to build, the cases, the expected
result of each case, and the form in which to report a run. It is written so
that you can do all of it without asking us anything.

The reference side of every run is this repository at a commit you name.

## 1. Roles

| Role | You build | Runs against | Who writes the result file |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `server` | A supplier agent (A2A server) that implements spec Sections 4-8 | the reference buyer, `python -m aae_a2a.crossrun client` | the reference buyer |
| `client` | A buyer agent (A2A client) that implements spec Sections 5, 6 and the checks of 6.3 | the reference supplier, `python -m aae_a2a.crossrun serve` | your client |
| `both` | Both of the above | each other, with no reference code in the loop | your client |

A `server` run is the cheaper one to report, because the reference buyer runs
every case and writes the file for you. A `client` run needs your client to
produce the result file itself (Section 6).

### What a server must offer

- An Agent Card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` declaring the extension URI
  `https://moltrust.ch/extensions/aae/v1` with `required: true` and the
  `params` of spec Section 4: `draft` `draft-kroehl-agentic-trust-aae-02`,
  `audience` (the URL of your JSON-RPC endpoint), `skills`
  `{"get-quote": {"action": "read"}, "place-order": {"action": "pay"}}`,
  `did_methods` `["example"]`, `accepted_issuers` `["did:example:issuer"]`.
- The JSON-RPC binding of A2A v1.0 (`SendMessage`). The reference buyer uses
  `a2a-sdk` 1.2.2.
- DID resolution for the documents in
  [`tests/vectors/crossrun/did/`](tests/vectors/crossrun/did/), loaded
  locally. `did:example` is never resolved over the network (spec Section 7.4,
  -02 Section 5.2).
- A `place-order` skill that succeeds unless `transaction.items` names a `sku`
  outside `["PAPER-A4", "TONER-K1"]`, and then fails after the AAE was
  accepted. This is what produces the paired case (XR-02 against XR-03).
- A clock within a few minutes of UTC. The reference buyer issues AAEs valid
  from five minutes ago to one hour ahead. Cases XR-14 to XR-17 place `iat`
  30 seconds inside or outside the window of spec Section 7.4 step 4, so client
  and server clocks must agree to within 30 seconds for those four.

### What a client must do

- Discover the card, check `draft`, and present an AAE in
  `metadata[URI].aae` with exactly one data part `{"skill", "transaction"}`
  (spec 6.1), sending `A2A-Extensions: https://moltrust.ch/extensions/aae/v1`.
- Answer the challenge of `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` with a JWS over
  `{nonce, aud, iat, aae_id}` after checking `aud` and `aae_id` (spec 6.3).
- Read the result from `Task.metadata[URI].result` and recompute
  `request_digest` from the request part it sent (spec 8.5).
- Build the AAE variants of Section 3 for the cases it runs.

## 2. Inputs

| Input | Path |
| :-- | :-- |
| Profile | [`spec/aae-a2a-extension-v1.md`](spec/aae-a2a-extension-v1.md) |
| Cases, machine-readable | [`tests/vectors/crossrun/cases.json`](tests/vectors/crossrun/cases.json) |
| DID documents | [`tests/vectors/crossrun/did/`](tests/vectors/crossrun/did/) |
| Test keys | [`tests/vectors/crossrun/test-keys.json`](tests/vectors/crossrun/test-keys.json) |
| `request_digest` vectors | [`tests/vectors/request-digest.json`](tests/vectors/request-digest.json), spec Appendix B |
| -02 Section 5 vectors | [MoltyCel/aae-conformance-vectors](https://github.com/MoltyCel/aae-conformance-vectors) at `2f117799c604f258e67d5c13d69fea63881bdae0` (spec Section 13) |

The test keys are Ed25519 seeds derived as
`SHA-256(UTF-8("aae-a2a-extension/testkey/v1/" + name))`. They are public by
construction and exist only for tests. `issuer` signs AAEs (`assertionMethod`),
`buyer` is the subject and signs challenge responses (`authentication`),
`mallory` has a key and no DID document.

A client may use its own DIDs and keys instead. Start the reference supplier
with `--did-dir <directory of your DID documents>` and
`--accept-issuer <your issuer DID>`; the expected results stay the same.

## 3. Variants

### Audience

Every case depends on one audience value: the challenge carries it as `aud`,
and `allowed_domains` is built from its host.

- In an interactive run the audience is `params.audience` of the Agent Card
  the client discovered, the URL of the server's JSON-RPC endpoint (Section 1).
  The reference supplier sets it from `--public-url`, or from
  `http://<host>:<port>`.
- In an offline run (Section 6.1) there is no endpoint to name. The audience is
  `https://supplier.example/a2a/jsonrpc`, the value of the spec's Section 4
  example, and the host in `allowed_domains` is `supplier.example`.

### AAE and challenge-response variants

"Now" is the server's clock in an interactive run and the evaluation instant
in an offline run. Each case names an AAE variant and a challenge-response
variant. Unless a variant says otherwise, the AAE is a VC secured as an EdDSA compact JWS with
`cty` `aae+json` and `kid` `did:example:issuer#key-1`, issuer
`did:example:issuer`, subject `did:example:buyer`, and:

- `mandate`: `actions` `["read", "pay"]`, `purpose`, `scope`, `principal_did`
  as in `aae_a2a/testkeys.py` `buyer_mandate()`;
- `constraints`: `max_transaction_value` `{"value": 500, "currency": "EUR",
  "required": true}` and `allowed_domains` `{"value": [<host of
  params.audience>], "required": true}`;
- `validity`: `not_before` five minutes ago, `not_after` in one hour,
  `single_use` `false`; `validFrom` equal to `not_before`.

| AAE variant | Difference from the above |
| :-- | :-- |
| `valid` | none |
| `forged` | the same header, signed with `mallory`'s key |
| `expired` | `not_before` two hours ago, `not_after` one hour ago |
| `read_only` | `mandate.actions` `["read"]` |
| `other_domain` | `allowed_domains` `["other-supplier.example"]` |
| `none` | no `aae` member; `metadata[URI]` and the message `extensions` are left out |
| `single_use` | `validity.single_use` `true` |
| `payload_not_json` | the same header, signed with `issuer`'s key over the payload bytes `{"issuer": "did:example:issuer", ` (not JSON) |
| `duplicate_issuer` | the `valid` payload with a first member `"issuer": "did:example:other-agent"` added in front of it, so `issuer` appears twice; signed with `issuer`'s key |

| Response variant | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `valid` | JWS over the challenge plus `iat` (now), `kid` `did:example:buyer#key-1`, signed with `buyer`'s key |
| `wrong_key` | the same, signed with `mallory`'s key |
| `iat_past_inside` | `valid` with `iat` 330 seconds before now |
| `iat_past_outside` | `valid` with `iat` 390 seconds before now |
| `iat_future_inside` | `valid` with `iat` 30 seconds after now |
| `iat_future_outside` | `valid` with `iat` 90 seconds after now |

The spec fixes the `iat` window at now minus 360 seconds to now plus 60
seconds (Section 7.4 step 4). XR-14 to XR-17 sit 30 seconds on either side of
each bound. XR-18 and XR-19 test the reading order of Section 7.2: the
signature is valid in both, the payload is parsed once and strictly, and both
fail at step 2. A receiver that reads `issuer` for step 1 with a first-wins
parser would reject XR-19 at step 1 instead.

`activate: false` means the presentation is sent without the
`A2A-Extensions` header.

## 4. Cases and expected results

Every case is one new task (XR-20: two, one per presentation) with the request part `{"skill": "place-order",
"transaction": <below>}`, run in the order listed. A `server` run covers all
cases. A `client` run must cover the `required` ones and may skip the
`optional` ones.

| Case | Client-side run | AAE / response | `transaction` (skill `place-order`) | Expected | `request_digest` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

XR-06 and XR-20 form the retry pair. For both, `cases.json` states two
expectations apart:

- *authorization*: the outcome of every step except step 5 for that
  presentation, as if no earlier use were counted. It is `ACCEPT` with steps 1,
  2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 in all three presentations.
- *admission*: step 5 against what the server has already accepted. XR-06 is
  admitted. XR-20 is admitted the first time; the second time the same valid
  authorization is not admitted, at step 5 with `single_use_already_consumed`.

A live run observes admission through the verdict. Authorization cannot be
observed from a rejection at step 5, since the server stops there; it is
checked on the pinned bundle (Section 5). XR-20 presents one AAE twice, each
time as a new task with its own challenge. The result entry carries an
`attempts` list with one entry per presentation, each with the members of a
task entry (Section 6).

The `request_digest` column is the value of spec Section 8.5 for that request
part; the result of a rejection carries it as well (spec 8.2). XR-04 uses the
member order, `120.0` and non-ASCII string of vector B.2, so it fails if
either side hashes something other than the JCS form of the request part.

## 5. Running

Install once (Python 3.12): `make install`, or
`python -m pip install --require-hashes --no-deps -r requirements.txt`.

**Reference against reference** (what CI does, and the baseline for your
run):

```
scripts/crossrun-local.sh            # or: make crossrun
```

This starts the reference supplier and the reference buyer as two processes on
`127.0.0.1`, runs all cases, writes `.crossrun/local.json`, validates it, and
logs every decision the supplier made to `.crossrun/supplier-decisions.jsonl`.

**Pinned bundle** — fixed bytes for XR-01, XR-06 and XR-20, for a verifier
that checks bytes rather than running a client, and for comparing two runs
byte for byte. [`tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned/`](tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned/)
holds:

| File | Content |
| :-- | :-- |
| [`bundle.json`](tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned/bundle.json) | `verify_at`, the card `params` (audience `https://supplier.example/a2a/jsonrpc`, skills, DID methods, accepted issuers), the nonce derivation, and per case the request part, the AAE file and per attempt the challenge, the response file and the expected result with `authorization` and `admission` |
| `XR-01.aae.jws`, `XR-06.aae.jws`, `XR-20.aae.jws` | the AAEs, one per case; XR-20's is single-use |
| `XR-01.1.response.jws`, `XR-06.1.response.jws`, `XR-20.1.response.jws`, `XR-20.2.response.jws` | the challenge responses, one per attempt, `iat` equal to `verify_at` |
| `did/` | the DID documents of [`tests/vectors/crossrun/did/`](tests/vectors/crossrun/did/), copied |
| [`MANIFEST.sha256`](tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned/MANIFEST.sha256) | the SHA-256 of every other file in the bundle; `shasum -a 256 -c MANIFEST.sha256` in the directory checks them |

A challenge response answers one nonce, and a server mints the nonce. For the
pinned responses to verify, the supplier has to mint exactly the pinned nonces,
so the bundle fixes what a deployment never fixes: the nonce key and the random
part, both derived from public labels (`bundle.json`, `nonce`). Run it with the
supplier's clock fixed at `verify_at`:

```
.venv/bin/python -m aae_a2a.crossrun serve --port 8790 --pinned tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned
.venv/bin/python -m aae_a2a.crossrun client --url http://127.0.0.1:8790 --pinned tests/vectors/crossrun/pinned
```

`--pinned` fixes the clock at `verify_at`, the audience and the nonce
derivation; `--at <RFC 3339 UTC>` alone fixes only the clock and can be used
with any run. Present the cases in order and each attempt as a new task. The
client checks that every challenge equals the pinned one before it answers, and
compares each attempt with its expected result. `python -m aae_a2a.crossrun pin`
rebuilds the bundle; the result is byte-identical, since every input is fixed
and Ed25519 signatures are deterministic.

**Role `server`** — the reference buyer against your supplier:

```
.venv/bin/python -m aae_a2a.crossrun client \
  --url https://your-supplier.example \
  --out crossruns/2026-11-02-yourname-server.json \
  --participant "Your Name" --participant-url https://github.com/you \
  --server-impl "your-supplier" --server-repo https://github.com/you/your-supplier \
  --server-commit <40-character SHA of your server>
```

`--url` is the base URL under which your Agent Card is served. The exit status
is non-zero if any case fails.

**Role `client`** — your buyer against the reference supplier:

```
.venv/bin/python -m aae_a2a.crossrun serve --port 8790 \
  --record crossruns/2026-11-02-yourname-client.decisions.jsonl
```

Point your client at `http://127.0.0.1:8790`. `--public-url` sets the
audience if the supplier is reached under another URL. The decision log has
one line per task with `task_id`, `task_state`, `verdict`, `step`,
`reason_code` and `request_digest`, so both sides of the run can be compared
line by line.

**Role `both`**: run your client against your server and write the result file
as in Section 6. Name the commits of both sides.

## 6. Result file

One JSON file per run, format `aae-a2a-crossrun/1`. See
[`crossruns/TEMPLATE.json`](crossruns/TEMPLATE.json).

| Member | Content |
| :-- | :-- |
| `format` | `"aae-a2a-crossrun/1"` |
| `profile`, `draft` | the extension URI and `draft-kroehl-agentic-trust-aae-02` |
| `cases_sha256` | `sha256:` and the SHA-256 of `cases.json` as run, so a later change of the cases is visible |
| `run_at` | RFC 3339 UTC |
| `participant` | `name` to credit, optional `url` |
| `client`, `server` | `implementation`, `repository`, `commit` (40-character SHA), `dirty: true` if the working tree differed from that commit; `server.agent_card` |
| `cases` | one entry per case, in order (below) |
| `summary` | `{"pass", "fail", "skipped"}` counts |

Each entry in `cases`:

| Member | When | Content |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `id` | always | case id |
| `result` | always | `pass`, `fail` or `skipped` |
| `task_id`, `task_state` | a task was returned | as returned |
| `verdict` | a task was returned | `result.verdict`, `ACCEPT` or `REJECT` |
| `request_digest` | a task was returned | `result.request_digest`, as returned (not recomputed) |
| `steps_passed` | `ACCEPT` | integers |
| `step`, `reason_code` | `REJECT` | as returned |
| `jsonrpc_code`, `reason_code` | JSON-RPC error | the error code and `ErrorInfo.metadata.reason_code` if present |
| `attempts` | a case with several presentations (XR-20) | one entry per presentation, in order, each with the members above that apply |
| `notes` | optional | free text, for example a differing `reason_code` |

A case passes when `task_state`, `verdict`, `request_digest` and, for a
rejection, `step` equal the expected values, an accepted case has
`steps_passed` containing 1 to 7, XR-06's task id differs from XR-01's, and
where a case states `admission`, the verdict is `ACCEPT` exactly when the
presentation is to be admitted. For XR-20 each attempt passes on its own and
the attempts are distinct tasks.
For an error case, `jsonrpc_code` decides. A different `reason_code` is a note,
not a failure: spec 8.4 lets a server use codes it does not list.

### 6.1 Offline receiver runs

In an offline run a receiver you built decides each case from artefacts a
client wrote, with no live counterpart: no Agent Card, no HTTP and no commits
on the other side to name. The receiver plays the server role, so it decides
every case and none may be skipped. Report it in the same format with
`"form": "offline"` and these members in place of `client` and `server`. See
[`crossruns/TEMPLATE-offline.json`](crossruns/TEMPLATE-offline.json).

| Member | Content |
| :-- | :-- |
| `form` | `"offline"`; absent or `"interactive"` means the form above |
| `receiver` | `implementation` and `version`; `commit` (40-character SHA) if the receiver is in a repository, otherwise `content_sha256` (`sha256:` and the SHA-256 of an archive of its code); optional `repository` |
| `audience` | `https://supplier.example/a2a/jsonrpc` (Section 3, "Audience") |
| `evaluation_instant` | the RFC 3339 UTC instant every temporal check used and every issued validity window was computed from |
| `inventions` | one `{"what", "choice"}` per point where the profile or this guide is silent and the run had to choose, under the participant's name; an empty list if there were none |

The case entries and the pass rule are those of the interactive form. A run
that derives task ids deterministically so that it reproduces records that as
an invention; the profile leaves the form of task ids open (spec Section 8.3).

Validate before reporting:

```
.venv/bin/python -m aae_a2a.crossrun check crossruns/2026-11-02-yourname-server.json
```

`check` recomputes `pass` or `fail` from what each entry records, so a file
cannot claim a pass its own observations do not support. For an interactive
run it also requires commit SHAs for both sides and every `required` case; for
an offline run it requires the members of Section 6.1 and every case.

## 7. Reporting a run

1. Publish the result file in your own repository if you can; that is your
   record of the run.
2. Open a pull request against this repository that adds the file under
   [`crossruns/`](crossruns/) as `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<participant>-<role>.json` and
   one row in the credit table of [`crossruns/README.md`](crossruns/README.md).
   CI runs `check` on every file there. If you would rather not open a pull
   request, open an issue with the file attached or linked.
3. A failing case is worth reporting. Say in the pull request which side you
   think is wrong; if it is the reference, that is a bug here.

Runs are credited with the participant's name and the commits of both sides.

## 8. Not covered by this case set

Delegation chains (step 9) and grant evaluation (step 6 with `grants`) are in
the reference tests (`tests/test_flow.py`) and the conformance vectors, not in
this case set. There is no hosted reference endpoint; every run is local or
against an endpoint the participant operates.
